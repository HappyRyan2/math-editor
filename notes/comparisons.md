# Comparison of Math Editors
## Pencil and Paper
Advantages:
- Extremely pretty (if you have nice handwriting)
- Extremely expressible (you can draw anything you want)

Disadvantages:
- No copy/paste and other useful things
- Requires physical paper and writing utensils

## LaTeX (via Overleaf)
Advantages:
- Extremely pretty
- Extremely expressible

Disadvantages:
- Slow to write
- Limited by page width unless you change it (for virtual documents, why limit yourself to only one page width? My screen is much wider than that!)

## Markdown / Plaintext (with Atom / VSCode)
Advantages:
- Easy to write
- Has lots of cool keyboard shorcuts and extensibility

Disadvantages:
- Zero support for math

## Desmos (Scientific Calculator)
Advantages:
- Very easy to write
- Very pretty

Disadvantages:
- It's a calculator, not an editor. You can't save, and any text you write gets formatted like variables.
- Doesn't support all the math symbols (it has pi, tau, and summations, but it seems like that's about it).
